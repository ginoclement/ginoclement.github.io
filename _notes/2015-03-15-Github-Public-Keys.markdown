Just a cool little thing I found, but you can access anyone's public SSH keys on Github by appending `.keys` to the end of their profile URL. For example, if you navigate to [`https://github.com/ginoclement.keys`][publickeys] you will see my public keys.

[publickeys]:   https://github.com/ginoclement.keys
